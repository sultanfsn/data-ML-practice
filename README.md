# Data & ML Practice Repository

This repository contains many data and machine learning practice that I've done previously. Only located on my local file before, now it has been moved to this repository.

The files in this repository contains various machine learning and data algorithm practice using various libraries. From regression, classification, and clustering. Using pandas, scikit, pyspark, etc. Feel free to contact me to learn more about it.
